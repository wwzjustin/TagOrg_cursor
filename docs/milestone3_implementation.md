# Milestone 3: Admin Tools + Undo/Reset Implementation

## Overview

In this milestone, we have implemented advanced features for the Tab Organizer extension including an admin dashboard, undo functionality, user feedback flow for ML-generated groups, and comprehensive metrics tracking. These features enhance both the user experience and provide valuable insights for administrators.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Admin Dashboard
- Created a comprehensive admin dashboard (`index.html`, formerly `admin.html`) with multiple sections:
  - **Labels Section**: View all labels/categories (predefined, user-created, and ML-generated)
  - **Active Groups Section**: Monitor currently active tab groups across all windows
  - **Metrics Section**: Visualize usage statistics with interactive charts
  - **System Settings Section**: Manage global settings and defaults

### 2. Undo and Reset Functionality
- **Undo Button**: Added an undo button to revert the last grouping action
- **State History**: Implemented a history tracking system to store previous states
- **Smart Restoration**: Developed intelligent group restoration that maps tabs by URL
- **Multiple Undo Levels**: Support for up to 10 history states for multiple undo operations

### 3. User Feedback Flow
- **Feedback Button**: Added a feedback button (‚≠ê) for ML-generated groups
- **Feedback Dialog**: Created an intuitive feedback form with options to:
  - Rate if the grouping was helpful
  - Suggest a better category name
  - Provide additional comments
- **Feedback Processing**: Implemented backend processing that:
  - Stores feedback for analytics
  - Uses negative feedback to improve the ML categorizer
  - Extracts keywords from misclassified tabs
  - Adds suggested categories to the user's list

### 4. Metrics and Analytics
- **Group Creation Tracking**: Counts groups created by AI vs. manual methods
- **Usage Patterns**: Tracks frequency of different actions (grouping, ungrouping)
- **Time-based Analysis**: Supports viewing metrics by different time periods (week, month, all time)
- **Visual Charts**: Added visualizations for metrics using canvas-based charts
- **Accuracy Monitoring**: Tracks ML accuracy based on user feedback

### 5. Additional UI Improvements
- **Notifications**: Added a notification system for user feedback confirmation
- **Navigation**: Implemented tab-based navigation in the admin dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured mobile-friendly admin interface
- **Data Management**: Added tools for retention period control and data clearing

## Technical Implementation Details

### History Tracking System
The undo functionality uses a snapshot-based approach:
1. Before any grouping action, the current state is saved as a snapshot
2. Each snapshot stores tab and group information including URLs, titles, and group assignments
3. When undoing, we first ungroup all tabs and then recreate the groups from the snapshot
4. URL mapping is used to match tabs across snapshots, handling tab ID changes

### Feedback Processing Flow
When a user provides feedback on a group:
1. Feedback is stored in the `mlFeedback` array in Chrome storage
2. For negative feedback with a suggested category:
   - The suggestion is added to the user's categories
   - Keywords are extracted from the tabs' titles
   - The ML categorizer is updated with the new category and keywords
   - A higher weight (1.5) is applied to user feedback-based categories

### Admin Metrics Visualization
The metrics visualization uses HTML5 Canvas to create:
1. Line charts for group creation over time
2. Pie charts for AI vs. manual group distribution
3. Bar charts for ML accuracy

## Admin Access and Security
The admin dashboard is accessible via:
1. Direct navigation to `index.html` (formerly `admin.html`)
2. A link in the options page footer

As specified in the PRD, no additional authentication beyond Chrome's extension mechanisms is implemented, focusing on a lightweight admin solution.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements include:
- More sophisticated tab analysis for better ML categorization
- Enhanced admin filters for more detailed data views
- Export/import functionality for user settings
- Advanced visualization options for metrics
- Performance optimizations for large history states
