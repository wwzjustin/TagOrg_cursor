# Milestone 2: AI Grouping Integration Implementation

## Overview

In this milestone, we have implemented AI-based tab grouping capabilities in the Tab Organizer extension. The implementation includes a Machine Learning (ML) categorizer that uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for more accurate tab grouping, a user interface for editing and approving ML suggestions, and the necessary infrastructure to support these features.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. ML-based Tab Categorizer
- Created a new `MLTabCategorizer` class in `ml-categorizer.js` using TF-IDF algorithm
- Implemented learning capabilities that analyze tab content for more accurate grouping
- Added confidence scoring to indicate how certain the ML model is about each categorization
- Designed the system to work without external APIs, keeping all processing local

### 2. AI Grouping UI
- Added a new AI grouping dialog that shows suggested groups with confidence indicators
- Implemented UI for users to edit, approve, or reject ML-generated suggestions
- Included tab previews in suggestion groups to help users understand grouping decisions
- Added visual indication (ML badge) to distinguish ML-generated groups from manual groups

### 3. Settings for ML Customization
- Added new settings in the options page for ML customization:
  - Toggle for using advanced ML categorizer vs. simple categorizer
  - Confidence threshold slider to control grouping strictness
  - Option to enable/disable user feedback collection
  - Automatic group suggestion for new tabs

### 4. Background Processing
- Updated background script to initialize and use the ML categorizer
- Implemented suggestion system for new tabs when auto-grouping is enabled
- Created a worker wrapper to properly load dependencies in the service worker

### 5. User Category Management
- Enhanced category management to support ML-specific features
- Added keyword weighting system for better categorization
- Integrated user-defined categories into the ML categorizer with higher weights

## Technical Implementation Details

### TF-IDF Algorithm
The ML categorizer uses TF-IDF to analyze tab content. This algorithm:
1. Tokenizes tab titles, URLs, and domain information
2. Calculates term frequency (how often a word appears)
3. Calculates inverse document frequency (how unique a word is across all tabs)
4. Combines these metrics to identify the most distinctive terms for categorization

### Learning Process
The ML categorizer learns from all open tabs before making categorization decisions:
1. It preprocesses all tabs to extract meaningful terms
2. Builds a document frequency index to understand term distribution
3. Uses this learned information to calculate TF-IDF scores
4. Makes categorization decisions based on these scores

### UI Integration
The AI grouping interface allows users to:
1. View suggested tab groups with confidence indicators
2. Rename suggested groups before applying
3. Select which suggestions to apply
4. See tab previews within each suggested group

## User Experience Improvements

- **Visual feedback**: Added confidence indicators and ML badges
- **Customization**: Users can fine-tune ML behavior through settings
- **Transparency**: Suggestions are presented for approval rather than automatically applied
- **Editing capability**: Users can modify suggestions before accepting them

## Next Steps

For future iterations, we could consider:
- Implementing more advanced natural language processing techniques
- Adding a user feedback mechanism to improve ML accuracy over time
- Creating a learning system that adapts to user preferences and patterns
- Developing more visualization tools for understanding tab relationships
