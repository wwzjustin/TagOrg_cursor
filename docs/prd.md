# AI Tab Organizer - Product Requirements Document

## üìå Overview  
A Chrome extension that uses AI to automatically suggest tab group labels based on content. Users can also create and manage their own tab groupings manually. The goal is to reduce tab overload and improve browsing productivity.

## üß† Core Features

### 1. **AI Grouping**  
- Automatically recommends and applies labels to open tabs using content/context
- Users can enter their own categories to influence grouping suggestions
- Uses OpenAI to analyze tab content, titles, and URLs for relevant grouping
- Provides visual indication of AI-generated groups vs. manual groups

### 2. **Manual Labeling**  
- Users can manually create custom tab groups and assign tabs
- Tabs can be moved between groups or ungrouped
- Drag-and-drop interface for intuitive tab management
- Option to save frequently used grouping configurations

### 3. **Admin View**  
- Admin user can view:
  - All labels created by any user
  - Tabs currently grouped under each label
  - Usage metrics for most common group categories
  - Feedback on AI grouping accuracy

### 4. **Undo & Reset**  
- Undo the last grouping action
- "Ungroup All" feature to reset groupings
- Ability to revert to previous grouping states
- Option to save preferred grouping states

## üíª Tech Stack Suggestions  

### Frontend
- Chrome Extension APIs for tab manipulation and grouping
- React for UI components and state management
- CSS modules for styling

### Backend/Services
- OpenAI API (GPT-4 or similar) for tab categorization via text content or title
- Chrome Storage API for local persistence
- Optional: Firebase for admin analytics and cross-device sync in future versions

### Development Tools
- Webpack for bundling
- ESLint/Prettier for code quality
- Jest for unit testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## üîÑ Milestones

### **Milestone 1: Manual Grouping MVP** (4 weeks)
- UI to create, rename, and delete groups  
- Assign open tabs to groups via drag or dropdown  
- Basic data persistence using Chrome Storage
- Extension popup with group management interface
- Initial user testing and feedback collection

### **Milestone 2: AI Grouping Integration** (6 weeks)
- Integrate OpenAI or similar service to auto-label open tabs  
- UI for editing or approving AI suggestions  
- Settings to input custom categories
- Algorithm refinement based on user feedback
- Performance optimization for large numbers of tabs

### **Milestone 3: Admin Tools + Undo/Reset** (4 weeks)
- Create an admin dashboard to view all labels and tabs  
- Implement Undo and Ungroup All functions  
- Add user feedback flow for misgroupings
- Analytics dashboard for admins
- Documentation and help resources

## üñºÔ∏è UI/UX Specifications

### Main Popup Interface
- Clean, minimal design with focus on tab groups
- Color-coding for different group categories
- Intuitive controls for creating, editing, and managing groups
- Visual differentiation between AI-suggested and manual groups

### Group Creation Flow
1. User clicks "AI Group" button to trigger automatic grouping
2. Extension analyzes open tabs and suggests category labels
3. User can edit suggestions before confirming
4. Alternatively, user can manually create groups via "URL Group" button

### Admin Dashboard
- Secure login for admin access
- Comprehensive view of all user-created groups
- Metrics on most popular categories and grouping patterns
- Tools for managing system-wide settings

## üö´ Non-Goals  
- No user accounts or authentication beyond Google sign-in  
- No cross-device sync (for now)
- No analytics beyond basic admin needs
- No tab content modification or blocking
- No paid subscription features in initial release

## üìä Success Metrics
- User retention rate after 7 and 30 days
- Average number of tab groups created per session
- Percentage of users utilizing AI grouping vs. manual grouping
- User-reported productivity improvement
- Time saved managing tabs (self-reported)

## üîç Privacy & Security Considerations
- Minimal data collection, focusing only on tab titles and URLs for grouping
- Clear transparency about AI usage and data handling
- No persistent storage of browsing history beyond current session
- Compliance with Chrome Web Store policies and GDPR

## üîÑ Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Cross-device synchronization
- Custom theming options
- Advanced group management (nested groups, saved configurations)
- Integration with productivity tools (Notion, Trello, etc.)
- Machine learning to improve grouping based on user behavior
